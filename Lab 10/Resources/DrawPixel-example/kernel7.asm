; Raspberry Pi B+,2 'Bare Metal' 16BPP Draw Pixel at any XY:
; 1. Setup Frame Buffer
;    assemble struct with screen requirements
;    receive pointer to screen or NULL
; 2. Start loop
;    Send pixel colour to location on screen
;    increment counter and loop if < 640

;note: r6 (colour) is 32-bit/4 byte register.
;at 16 bits/pixel, writing 32bits to adjacent pixels overwrites every second pixel.
; soln: write lower 2 bytes only (STRH) or lower byte(STRB).
;r0 = pointer + x * BITS_PER_PIXEL/8 + y * SCREEN_X * BITS_PER_PIXEL/8
